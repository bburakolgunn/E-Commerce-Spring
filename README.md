This project is a simulation of an e-commerce project. By researching the basic needs of an e-commerce company, the necessary product transactions can be added to the cart and purchased along with customer transactions. It is a rest Service project written in the spring and used as a MySql database. We provide e-mail using Spring Email for password change operations. With the jwt encryption logic, we can receive jwt and perform operations in accordance with these jwt authorities. The service project is tested in Postman.

The project offers a RestApi application that takes orders from an institution's customers and products, tracks the company's product additions and subsequent sales to its users. Spring Boot, Spring RestApi, Spring Security, JPA, MS Sql, Javax Validation and Spring Mail Framework APIs are used in the project software. In the project, services were procured according to roles using the JWT method. In the project, the data consumed regularly when needed was worked with cache methods and the application cost was brought to the most ergonomic level. PostMan tools were used in the documentation of this project and adapted to OpenApi standards.
